This script can pull ntlmssp hashes with the challenge/response from a pcap.

Supports:
    - NTLMv1 (LM:NT hash)
    - NTLMv2 (Just NT)
    - HTTP Auth
    - Proxy Auth
    

Requires scapy

USAGE:
python rewrite.py <file.pcap>

tshark is no longer required after the rewrite, although
running 

tshark -r in.pcap 'ntlmssp' -F libpcap -w out.pcap

might speed up for massive pcaps
